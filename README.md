# Bankist-Mock-Bank-App
A mock banking app, created with the udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This was created to teach myself on creating a basic login/logout function, as well as manipulating and updating stored financial data from an array.

A demonstration of this app can be found here: https://bankist-bankapp.netlify.app/
